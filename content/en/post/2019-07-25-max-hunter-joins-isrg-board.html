<p>Max Hunter, of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), brings a wealth of technology and privacy experience as the newest member of the ISRG Board of Directors. “Three years ago only 40% of page loads were encrypted. There’s been a fundamental shift for the Internet as a whole and I’m tremendously excited to be part of a project that is so successful,” he said.</p>

<p>EFF has long had representation on our board and Max will continue that as current EFF member, Peter Eckersley, departs. We’d like to thank Peter for his contributions to ISRG and look forward to a future of friendship.</p>

<p>Max offers valuable perspective on our recommended ACME client software, [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/), which is run and maintained by his team at EFF. Certbot is an important part of the ACME ecosystem as one of the most popular clients for requesting a Let’s Encrypt certificate. It was also one of the first clients able to manage provisioned certificates and automatically request and install renewals. Max leads work on distribution-agnostic packaging for Certbot, building the documentation site, and making user testing-driven improvements for the software.</p>

<p>In his work at EFF, which is a non-profit like ISRG, Max focuses on helping populations of people who otherwise might not be able to advocate for themselves. We look forward to Max’s contributions in helping ISRG and Let’s Encrypt to continue to serve site visitors around the world to have a more privacy-respecting experience, regardless of their knowledge of encryption.</p>

<p>Fundraising is an essential part of ensuring the stability of ISRG and Let’s Encrypt. Every day, we issue more than one million certificates and there are costs associated with that service. Max has over a decade of experience in helping tech, arts, and mobility nonprofits with raising the funds they need to achieve their impact. He added, “Let’s Encrypt has become such a core pillar of the Internet. I look forward to translating its mission for funders who share ISRG’s values.”</p>
