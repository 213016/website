<p>We are pleased to welcome Vicky Chin, Director of Desktop Product Development at Mozilla, to the ISRG Board of Directors!</p>

<p>Mozilla is an important part of the history of ISRG and has had a consistent role on the Board since its founding. Vicky steps into this role taking the place of longtime board member Laura Thomson. We are grateful for Laura’s leadership and cheer her on in her new role as VP of Engineering at Fastly.</p>

<p>Vicky is an ardent advocate of nonprofit tech as a hub for innovation for the public benefit. “Let’s Encrypt works so well because ISRG took a complex problem and figured out a way to solve it on a global scale,” she said.</p>

<p>Global impact has been a part of Vicky’s career since her time at IBM. She served in Nigeria’s Cross River State providing pro-bono work via IBM’s Corporate Service Corps. “I was pleased to apply my professional skills to a greater cause.”</p>

<p>Seeking that greater good led Vicky to her current role at Mozilla.  A fellow nonprofit whose values align closely with ISRG, Mozilla is central to the work of ensuring a free and open Web. “Paramount to ensuring the Internet continues to be the most fundamental tool to connect, learn, and express, is the notion that the Web be free and open, safe and privacy-respecting. Let’s Encrypt is a critical component of the free and open Web,” she shared.</p>

<p>With her enthusiasm on the importance of the nonprofit sector, Vicky will bring tremendous perspective on championing ISRG’s value and impact to people around the world. She added, “I’m excited to join the Board as an advocate to bring more exposure to ISRG’s work.”</p>

<p>Please join me in welcoming Vicky to the ISRG Board of Directors!</p>
