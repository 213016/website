<p>We are happy to announce that Christine Runnegar, Senior Director of Internet Trust at Internet Society, joined the ISRG Board of Directors in late 2018.</p>

<p>Let’s Encrypt operates under a complex policy and legal framework and Christine brings great knowledge to help expand our perspective. As she stated, “Throughout my career, I’ve advocated for policies that support an open, globally-connected, secure, and trustworthy Internet for everybody.” Good policy frameworks are essential to providing our service; without them, it is hard for us to build the tech and create the services that will achieve our mission of creating a 100% encrypted Web for everyone.</p>

<p>Working with industry groups and policy bodies is an important part of what we do at ISRG and we welcome Christine’s contribution here as well.</p>

<p>Christine expands our board’s global perspective with her career experience. She worked for many years in the Australian government, and now occupies an internationally-focused role at Internet Society. “It’s my personal and professional mission to increase online privacy and security for Internet users all over the world,” she said. “During the course of my career, I have learned that not everyone has the same access or ability to take advantage of the privacy and security tools that are available. That is why I am very excited to be joining ISRG to help create a more secure and privacy-respecting Internet for everyone.”</p>

<p>Please join me in giving Christine a warm welcome!</p>
