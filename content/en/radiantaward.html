        <p>Internet Security Research Group and its partners are proud to present the Radiant Award for Advancing Internet Security, a recognition program for individuals whose contributions make the Internet more secure and privacy-respecting.</p>

        <p>Designed to shed light on efforts which often go unrecognized, Radiant Award recipients are thanked publicly for their work and provided a platform to express their motivations, inspiration, challenges, and plans.</p>

        <p>ISRG has brought together partners from across the Internet to provide honorees with a $10,000 gift. Intended to energize our selected individuals in whatever manner suits them, the gift is unstipulated.</p>

        <p>ISRG identifies Radiant Award recipients through input from its staff and community. Candidates are considered based on the merit of their work, the benefits of greater public exposure, and their contribution to the public good.
