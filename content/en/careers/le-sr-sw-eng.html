<p>We’re making HTTPS easier for developers to use, we’re doing it at scale, and we need your help. We’re a first-of-our-kind Certificate Authority (CA). We make certificates available to anyone, for free, and we offer an API to do it. This means more people can enable HTTPS on their websites, with less work. That protects everyone’s web traffic from snoops, and makes us all safer.</p>

<p>We’re looking for an additional software engineer. Maybe that’s you! Here’s what our software engineering team does:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We maintain Boulder, the server software that runs our ACME API. This includes:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Diagnosing and fixing bugs</li>
			<li>Finding scaling problems and fixing them</li>
			<li>Developing new features</li>
		</ul>
	<li>We maintain Pebble, a “small size” version of Boulder that helps developers test their ACME clients.</li>
	<li>We contribute to open source projects we depend on.</li>
	<li>We help run a community forum that helps developers and end users fix their problems, and moderate comments to ensure everything stays on-track. We are happy to say ours is the friendliest and most supportive HTTPS-related forum around.</li>
	<li>We participate in an on call rotation, one week in three. Since our SRE team handles most oncall events, we get paged rarely.</li>
	<li>We develop expertise on Public Key Infrastructure and advise the rest of the team on related changes.</li>
	<li>We participate in standards-development processes at IETF and elsewhere.</li>
	<li>We develop new products and new features. For instance, right now we’re planning work on an extra-secure memory-safe recursive resolver.</li>
	<li>We cross-train with our SRE team, learning some of their tools and processes, giving feedback and input on decision making, and receiving feedback on the tools we develop to be deployed by SRE.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what we’d like you to bring to our team:</p>

<ul>
	<li>At least a year’s experience writing code in Go, or a couple of years in another compiled language.</li>
	<li>Attention to detail and a willingness to spend the time it takes to get things right.</li>
	<li>Experience writing unit tests and integration tests.</li>
	<li>Excellent communication, organization, and prioritization skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior experience with cryptography and PKI is not required. We will provide on-the-job training.</p>

<p>Our team is 100% remote, within the US or Canada. A background check is required.</p>

<p>To apply, please submit your resume to: <a href="mailto:careers@letsencrypt.org">careers@letsencrypt.org</a></p>
